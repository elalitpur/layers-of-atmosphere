    <h2>About Earth's Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        The Earth's atmosphere is divided into five main layers based on temperature changes.
        Each layer has unique characteristics and plays an important role in protecting and
        supporting life on Earth.The Earth’s atmosphere is a thin layer of gases that surrounds our planet
         and makes life possible. It provides the air we breathe, protects us from harmful radiation from the
          Sun, and helps regulate the Earth’s temperature. Scientists divide the atmosphere into several 
          layers based on changes in temperature and altitude. Each layer has unique characteristics and plays
           an important role in protecting and supporting life on Earth.
    </p>

    <div class="layer">
        <h3>1. Troposphere</h3>
        <p><strong>Height:</strong> Surface to about 8–15 km</p>
        <p>
            The troposphere is the lowest layer and contains about 75% of the atmosphere’s mass
            and almost all water vapor. This is where humans live and where all weather occurs.
            It begins at the Earth’s surface and extends up to about 8 to 15 kilometers, depending on location.
             This layer contains most of the atmosphere’s air and nearly all of its water vapor, which makes it
              the place where weather occurs. Clouds, rain, wind, and storms all form in the troposphere, making
               it essential for supporting life on Earth.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clouds, rain, snow, and storms form here.</li>
            <li>Temperature decreases as altitude increases.</li>
            <li>Commercial airplanes usually fly in the upper troposphere.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="layer">
        <h3>2. Stratosphere</h3>
        <p><strong>Height:</strong> 15 km to 50 km</p>
        <p>
            The stratosphere is above the troposphere and contains the ozone layer, which
            absorbs harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun.The stratosphere is the
             second layer of the Earth’s atmosphere, located above the troposphere. It 
             extends from about 15 kilometers to around 50 kilometers above the Earth’s surface.
              This layer is important because it contains the ozone layer, which absorbs most of 
              the Sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation. Unlike the troposphere, temperatures in the
               stratosphere increase with altitude, making it more stable and less turbulent.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Temperature increases with altitude due to ozone absorbing UV rays.</li>
            <li>Weather balloons and some aircraft fly in this layer.</li>
            <li>It is very dry with little water vapor.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="layer">
        <h3>3. Mesosphere</h3>
        <p><strong>Height:</strong> 50 km to 85 km</p>
        <p>
            The mesosphere is the coldest layer of the atmosphere. Most meteors burn up
            in this layer before reaching Earth's surface.The stratosphere is the second
            layer of the Earth’s atmosphere, located above the troposphere. It extends
            from about 15 kilometers to around 50 kilometers above the Earth’s surface. 
            This layer is important because it contains the ozone layer, which absorbs
            most of the Sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation. Unlike the troposphere,
            temperatures in the stratosphere increase with altitude, making it more 
            stable and less turbulent.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Temperatures can drop to -90°C.</li>
            <li>Meteors create bright streaks of light here.</li>
            <li>Very thin air makes it difficult to study directly.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="layer">
        <h3>4. Thermosphere</h3>
        <p><strong>Height:</strong> 85 km to 600 km</p>
        <p>
            The thermosphere is a very hot layer due to absorption of high-energy solar radiation.
            Despite high temperatures, it would not feel hot because the air is extremely thin.
            The thermosphere is the fourth layer of the Earth’s atmosphere, lying above the
            mesosphere and extending from about 85 kilometers to 600 kilometers above the
            Earth’s surface. In this layer, temperatures rise significantly due to the absorption
             of high-energy solar radiation. The thermosphere is also where phenomena like the 
             auroras occur, and it is the region where satellites and the International Space 
             Station orbit the Earth.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The International Space Station orbits here.</li>
            <li>Auroras (Northern and Southern Lights) occur in this layer.</li>
            <li>Temperature increases dramatically with altitude.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="layer">
        <h3>5. Exosphere</h3>
        <p><strong>Height:</strong> 600 km to 10,000 km</p>
        <p>
            The exosphere is the outermost layer and gradually fades into outer space.
            Particles of gas can escape into space from this region.It contains very
            few particles, mostly hydrogen and helium, which are so spread out that
            they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding. The exosphere
            acts as the transition between Earth’s atmosphere and space, gradually 
            fading into the vacuum of space.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mainly composed of hydrogen and helium.</li>
            <li>Satellites orbit within this layer.</li>
            <li>It has extremely low air density.</li>
        </ul>
